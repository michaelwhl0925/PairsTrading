# PairsTrading
In this program, I am going to backtest another common trading strategy - Pairs Trading.

Stocks: Visa & MasterCard

I will first use Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check whether the pair of stocks are stationary or not, i.e. if they are cointegrated.
Trading signals and PnL are then generated
